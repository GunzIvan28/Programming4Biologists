# Introduction to Programming for Biologists

Lecture workspace for the MSc Bioinformatics at Pwani University. Here is an outline of what we will learn in this course:

1. Introduction to Computing and Computational thinking: [Lecture](Lecture/Programming_And_ComputationalThinking.pdf)
2. A lecture on [Open science and reproducible research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18ldedgpdM9S1ve_Gw9JRRvXZmssZALXfapOAkvYjCU4/edit?usp=sharing)
2. [Introduction to Git and GitHub for version control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NVHLHiL-tw-3e5KYFY-N_ISjWgGHIs45eAypEUep_hU/edit#slide=id.g3e08b71c2d_1_0): Hands-on session
3. Introduction to Linux on the command line:
      - Basic commands: [Rik's page commands live coding](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp)
      - Dive deeper to Linux and scripting: [lecture materials from IBT by Amel](https://github.com/amelgh/Introduction_To_Linux)
      - Setting up a reproducible Bioinformatics project workspace
4. [Python for Bioinformatics](https://github.com/kipkurui/Python4Bioinformatics2019)
      - Setting up and working with Python on IDLE console and the various text editors we can use
      - Setting up Jupyter Notebooks and the conda environment
      - Go through the materials on the Jupyter Notebooks starting from introduction all the way to Biopython but we do not cover the section on Object-Oriented programming

### Projects
During this course, you will work on a python programming project, in which you will get to utilize the newfound skills, and learn even more by doing. I will use GitHub classroom for this part since you will be required to submit your work via GitHub. 

### Assignments
The notebooks are infused with programming exercises on genomic data parsing and analysis. 

### Teaching approach

We will use a lot of live coding in class, and very few lectures. I will, however, provide some reference text for a deeper grasp of the programming concepts. My focus will be to teach the thinking behind computing. How to turn a biological problem to a computational problem, and solve it using bash scripting or Python. The focus is on thinking.
